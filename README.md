# IMMO-ELIZA-ML


[![forthebadge made-with-python](https://ForTheBadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)](https://www.python.org/)

## 🧐 Description
In the Immo-Eliza-ML project we will build a performant machine learning model to predict prices of real estate proporties in Belgium. This involves cleaning the dataset, preprocessing, model training, model evaluation and iteration.

### ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fabienne088/immo-eliza-ml.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd IMMO-ELIZA-ML
    ```

3. You're all set! You can now explore the  notebooks in the `drafts` and `models` directories and work with the data in the `data` directory. Enjoy!

## 🎈 Usage
To use this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
    - Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fabienne088/immo-eliza-ml.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    - Once cloned, navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd IMMO-ELIZA-ML
    ```

3. **Explore drafts Notebooks**:
    - The `drafts` directory contains Jupyter notebooks (`*.ipynb`) where you can see step by step cleaning, splitting and preprocessing of the data. Inluding try-outs of model training and evalution. Open these notebooks in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to view the analyses and results.

4. **Access models**:
    - The `models` directory contains a LinearRegression  and a RandomForestRegression model. Including training and evaluation.

5. **Work with Data**:
    - The `data` directory contains the dataset used for preprocessing. You can find both raw and clean versions of the dataset. Explore the data files to understand their structure and contents.
