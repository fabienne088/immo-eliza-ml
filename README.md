# IMMO-ELIZA-ML


[![forthebadge made-with-python](https://ForTheBadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)](https://www.python.org/)

## Description
In the Immo-Eliza-ML project we will build a performant machine learning model to predict prices of real estate proporties in Belgium. This involves cleaning the dataset, preprocessing, model training, model evaluation and iteration.

   - [![sklearn Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/sklearn-0.x-grey)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

   ## The dataset
It includes about 39000 properties scrapped from ImmoWeb: [Immoweb](https://www.immoweb.be) 

To run the program you'll need the requirements.txt containing the required libraries.

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mahsanazar/immo-eliza-DAMI-analysis.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd immo-eliza-DAMI-analysis
    ```

3. You're all set! You can now explore the analysis notebooks in the `analysis` and `reports` directories and work with the data in the `data` directory. Enjoy!

## 🛎️ Usage
To use this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
    - Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mahsanazar/immo-eliza-DAMI-analysis.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    - Once cloned, navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd immo-eliza-DAMI-analysis
    ```

3. **Explore Analysis Notebooks**:
    - The `analysis` directory contains Jupyter notebooks (`*.ipynb`) where you can explore various analyses performed on the data. Open these notebooks in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to view the analyses and results.

4. **Access Reports**:
    - The `reports` directory includes reports generated from the analysis. These reports may contain visualizations, insights, and conclusions drawn from the data analysis.

5. **Work with Data**:
    - The `data` directory contains the dataset used for analysis. You can find both raw and clean versions of the dataset. Explore the data files to understand their structure and contents.
